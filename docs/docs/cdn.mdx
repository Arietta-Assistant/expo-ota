# CDN

The CDN feature in **Expo Open OTA** allows you to serve your assets through a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve the performance of your app updates.
Currently only cloudfront is supported as a CDN provider.

:::note
The environment variables required for each cdn are listed below, you can set them in a `.env` file in the root of the project or keep them in a safe place to prepare for deployment.

## Cloudfront

The cloudfront CDN feature requires your storage mode to be set to `s3`. You can follow the [storage guide](/docs/storage) to set up your storage solution.

### Create a Cloudfront Distribution

1. Go to the [Cloudfront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home).
2. Click on **Create Distribution**.
3. Set your S3 bucket as the origin.
